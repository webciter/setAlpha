# setAlpha
Set both the Alpha Transparency of Text and Backgrounds maintaining inheritance overrides

<pre>
var element = document.getElementById("test");
element.setBackgroundAlpha(50); /* 50 transparency */
</pre>

Any element nested can also be change to it's own alpha transparency which was not possible with opacity css rule
